    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        In todayâ€™s educational system, managing attendance effectively is a growing challenge faced by students and faculty alike. Students often find themselves in situations where they are unable to attend classes due to personal or emergency reasons, resulting in a shortage of attendance. This can negatively impact their academic performance and participation in extracurricular activities such as workshops, seminars, and events, which are vital for their overall development.
        
        Furthermore, a lack of proper coordination with concerned authorities and the absence of an efficient communication system make it difficult for students to submit leave applications in a timely manner, thus missing out on important opportunities. Some students also miss notifications about beneficial upcoming events and activities. The absence of a centralized, automated solution for managing attendance and leave requests creates significant gaps in the current system.</p>
        
        <h3> Existing System</h3>
        <p>The existing attendance and leave management systems rely heavily on manual processes. Administrative users maintain records in hand-written registers or through traditional methods, which are time-consuming, prone to errors, and require significant human effort. These systems also rely on paper-based documentation, which is inefficient for maintaining and updating records.
        
        One major drawback of the existing system is the high likelihood of errors in data entry. If incorrect information is input, it may lead to misunderstandings or even rejection of leave applications. Additionally, the existing system is not user-friendly and often leads to delays in retrieving data, making it cumbersome for both students and faculty to access the necessary information. The manual nature of these systems makes it difficult to generate reports efficiently, and the process is typically time-consuming. Moreover, the possibility of data loss or mismanagement further exacerbates the situation, especially when reports or attendance records are misplaced.
        
        As a result, the administrative tasks related to attendance and leave management require specialized knowledge and a dedicated team, which often incurs additional costs. The existing systems cannot automate tasks efficiently, making the entire process prone to human error and delays.</p>
        
        <h3>Proposed System</h3>
        <p>The proposed Student Leave Management System addresses the shortcomings of the existing manual system by introducing a fully automated, digital solution that ensures efficient data management, transparency, and ease of access for students, faculty, and HODs (Head of Department). The system will be based on a secure and user-friendly online interface, allowing authorized users to access and update the necessary data from any location at any time.
        
        Key Features and Modules:
        The system will contain the following modules, each tailored to the role of the userâ€”Student, Faculty, and HOD:
